This algorithm is not finished (can't get camera/video processing software to compile).

This algorithm takes in a stream of video and trains ai to sense and classify any changes in the video such as a change in lighting or movement in the background.

The algorithm uses artificial neural networks and a specialized genetic algorithm to split up groups of neural networks to classify particular events; each group with a particular event. The genetic algorithm is resource based with bigger groups getting more resources, food, to survive while niche groups can recognize smaller harder to notice events that earn them small but steady streams of food.

Started project in late 2016. Worked on it for about a month.
