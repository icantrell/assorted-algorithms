# assorted-algorithms

In this folder is a list of projects and algorithms I have been working on, since 2016, 
some the projects are not finished and are labeled so in the readme files.
About half of the algorithms are made completely from my own inspiration and the
other half are algorithms that I learned from sources such as wikipedia.

The start and end dates of each project are in the readme files.
