This is a algorithm that gives an approxiamate solution to the traveling salesman problem in n dimensions using a minimum spanning tree. 

I used an html file to draw a graph since I could not get the ploting libraries to function correctly with python.

The algorithm may be working correctly but I have not done the proper test to prove it.

Started project in late march 2017 code was finished in about a week. and a half.
